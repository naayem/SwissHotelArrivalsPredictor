				<h1>Predicting Hotel Arrivals in Switzerland using Google Trends</h1>
				<p class="major">The project goal is to show how google trends can improve the predictions of a model initialy based on features monthly released. The idea is to point out how more recent datasets in time can be useful in better predicting near-future events; especially unusual events such as crisis. During our project, we will try to answer the following questions:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					<li><a href="#dataset">What does the DataSet look like?</a></li>
					<li><a href="#Hoteltrends">Which google trends are useful in predicting hotel arrivals in Switzerland?</a></li>
					<li><a href="#sugar">Is it possible find better Trends using web scraping?</a></li>
					<li><a href="#additives">Is it possible to improve the modelisation furthermore, by using Covid19 related Trends?</a></li>

				<h3>From which countries Switzerland hotel visitors originate from?</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px">Here are the Top 10 arrivals in Switzerland hotels per country during the year 2018. It is observed that most of the arrivals from Europe come from neigboring countries. Regarding the rest of the world, the most arrivals originate from: the United States of America, China, South Korea and India. This gives a good indicator on where (which country) and in which language the Google Trends must be chosen. However, it is notable to obsevre that China must be discarded as Google is not used in this country</p>

				<p>In the following plot is presented the monthly number of arrivals from 2018 to 2020, during the covid 19 crisis period, in Germany. It is clear that the arrivals drasticly decrease in 2020 during the months of March, April and May. Moreover, as Germany is a neighbor country of Switzerland, it highlights even more the scale of the crisis.</p>

				<h1>Baseline model and Google Trends</h1>
				<p class="align-left">The baseline model that we use to predict the arrivals is a simple Auto-Regressive model of order 2. To select the lags (features) that interest us, we use a PACF plot (plotted bellow). </p>

				<h3>How to select the lags of our base model?</h3>
				<p><span style="font-size:20px">PACF is a partial auto-correlation function. Instead of finding correlations of present with lags like ACF, it finds correlation of the residuals (which remains after removing the effects which are already explained by the earlier lag(s)) with the next lag value hence ‘partial’ and not ‘complete’ as we remove already found variations before we find the next correlation. For example, if we are regressing a variable Y on other variables X1, X2, and X3, the partial correlation between Y and X3 is the amount of correlation between Y and X3 that is not explained by their common correlations with X1 and X2. From the partial autocorrelation function we select some lags that have a big autocorrelation coefficient. We try to select the best lags for the base model (without including the Google trends). The idea is to find the best two lags in order to have a base model that fit well the true data wothout overfitting (that's why we only select two lags). To do so, we look at the mean absolute error (MAE) between the model predictions and the true data. We look at the MAE of all the different models (which have different lags) during three periods : the testing set without the crisis (from 2028/1/1 to 2020/2/1); the crisis only (.from 2020/2/1 to 2020/10/1); the whole testing set(2018/1/1 to 2020/10/1).

Ideally this model will be further improved by adding the Google trends.

To have an idea of how an autoregressive model behave, we first evaluate an AR model with only one lag, firstly with t-1 and then with t-12. This gives us an idea about the influence of these two lags.</p>

				<h3>Which google trends are useful in predicting hotel arrivals in Switzerland?</h3>
				<p>An analysis on the Trends showed that the most interesting Trends are :
Hotel
Travel\Touristic Destination\Switzerland
Ski in Switzerland

The three best trends were selected based on their p-values. A feature is considered good (i.e. worth using in the model) if it has a low p-value. Indeed, a low p-value means that it has low chances to happen under the null hypothesis. Here, the null Hypothesis would be "the Trends data is not an indicator of the number of hotel nights sold".</p>

				<h3>Ok, but what's wrong with that?</h3>
				<p>Palm oil is produced in countries which are less economically developed than the countries where the products containing it are sold. This often means the the main producers (Indonesia, Myanmar, ...) have less strict and enforced
					environmental policies than western countries. This leads palm oil producing companies to expand their plantations without control. The huge demand for palm oil in food products is the cause of a rapid expansion in palm oil plantation's land

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>In terms of sugar, the problem is quite different in Swizerland and North America.</p>
				<p>
					Switzerland is the world biggest chocolate consumer, according to
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_chocolate"> Wikipedia</a>
					or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2015/07/22/the-worlds-biggest-chocolate-consumers-infographic/#3662da084484">
						Forbes</a>: 11.6 kg per year per capita, roughly 15-20% of the sugar consumed yearly.
					In Swizerland, chocolate represents the large majority of the sugar in our manufactured snacks.
					This is due to some popular companies such as Lindt or Nestlé, who contributed to the design of today's chocolate.
				</p>
				<p>
					In North America, the sugary snacks are more various:
					surprisingly, popcorn is the most common sweetened product!
					Chocolate is also very present, but other examples include biscuits and candies.
					In average those snacks contain less sugar than those in Switzerland.
				</p>

				<p>From the perspective of the Open Food Facts dataset,
					sugary snacks is probably not the reason why people in the US consume more sugar.
					The main reason is rather that most of their casual groceries contains more sugar.
